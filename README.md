<h2>  Project review</h2>
Graph calculator is a simple GUI app capable of creating, loading, and editing weighted directed graphs. After receiving/loading a graph from a JSON file it can be used as the basis for many graph operations, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, finding the center, etc...<br>
The manipulated graph can be saved to json file.

<h2> How to run the calculator</h2>

<p>
To run the calcultor you should first create a JSON file that represent a graph. You can check the "data" directory in the main repository to see some examples of graphs files.<br>
Download the jar file found in the top level of the repository, and run it from a terminal using the following command:<br><strong> java -jar Ex2.jar graph.json </strong> , replacing of course graph.json with your file name.<br>
