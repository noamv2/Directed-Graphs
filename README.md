<h2>  Project review</h2>
Graph calculator is a simple GUI app capable of creating, loading, and editing weighted directed graphs. After receiving/loading a graph from a JSON file it can be used as the basis for many graph operations, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, finding the center, etc...<br>
The manipulated graph can be saved to json file.
</p>
<h2> How to run the calculator</h2>

<p>
To run the calculator you should first create a JSON file that holds a graph. You can check the "data" directory in the main repository to see some examples of graphs files.<br>
Download the jar file found in the top level of the repository, and run it from a terminal using the following command:<br><strong> java -jar Ex2.jar graph.json </strong>, replacing, of course, graph.json with your file name.<br>  
Now you should be looking at a visual representation of your graph.

from now on, all the interactions with the app will be done through the GUI.
